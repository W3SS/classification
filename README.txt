Classification README

A basic classification project to exemplify classification by Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms. There are two data sets included in the project; one is of emails to be classified as spam, and one is of photos to be classified as doors or not doors. The emails are featured by taking counts of the words in the emails. The doors are featured by making histograms of pixel counts for red, green, and blue.
